Frederick Richards Leyland (1831–1892) was a major British shipowner, running 25 steamships in the transatlantic trade. He was a major art collector, who commissioned works from several Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood painters. Leyland served as an apprentice in the firm of John Bibby, Sons & Co, where he rose to become a partner. In 1867, he took on the tenancy of Speke Hall, Liverpool, and in 1869 bought a house in London at 49 Princes Gate. Under his direction the Leyland line expanded into transatlantic trade. Leyland's first commissions were to Dante Gabriel Rossetti and James McNeill Whistler, from 1864 and 1867. Leyland collected Renaissance art and Albert Moore and commissioned Burne-Jones’s The Beguiling of Merlin, 1877. In the 1870s, Leyland commissioned Whistler to decorate his dining room, the Peacock Room that is now in the Smithsonian Museum's Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.
