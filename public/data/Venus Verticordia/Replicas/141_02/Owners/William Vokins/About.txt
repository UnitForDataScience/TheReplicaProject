William Vokins (1815-1895), art dealer. John Henry Vokins (1810/11-78) and William Vokins
(1815-95) became a leading firm of art dealers in the 19th-century. They specialized in watercolors.The
business had been begun by their father John Vokins (1788-1832). It was originally a carving and
gilding business. The firm was later taken over by William Vokins&#39; son James Theodore Vokins (1844-
1910) and ceased trading after his death. Vokins became a leading dealer, and a noted judge of English
watercolors. Up to 1858 he had a shop in John Street, off Oxford Street; then at 14 and 16 Great
Portland Street and 10 King Street, Pall Mall. It was about 1863 that Whistler was in contact with
Vokins. In 1864, Vokins, John and William Vokins, carvers and gilders, and dealers in works of art, had
their shop at 14 and 16 Great Portland Street (late 5 John Street) from 1860-1862, plus one at 3 Great
Castle Street, Oxford Street by 1864.
The firm was still in existence in 1900 as A. Vokins and Sons, &#39;printsellers, fine art dealers,
carvers, gilders, looking-glass and picture frame and moulding manufacturers, regilding done in every
branch&#39;, at 16 Holborn and 2 Leather Lane, London.
