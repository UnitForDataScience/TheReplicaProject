John Graham (1797-1887) of Glasgow, a textile and Port wine merchant (W. & J. Graham & Co. of Oporto established 1820), was also a great patron of the Arts with an outstanding collection, and the uncle of William Graham, a prominent patron of Rossetti’s. He rebuilt the Skelmorlie Castle in 1856 by restoring the old tower at his own expense, and adding the mansion house. His architect was William Railton of Kilmarnock. The first Rossetti picture bought by Graham was Morning Music bought in 1866 from the picture dealers Agnew’s. Graham was introduced to Rossetti in March 1868 and wrote, “I cannot tell you what a refreshment it is to get into the atmosphere of your studio after the jaded sense of dissatisfaction which exhibitions and picture dealers’ galleries give me.” He became a regular Saturday visitor to Rossetti’s home; his next purchase was Venus Verticordia in 1868 and then he commissioned works from Rossetti. His collection included Ecce Ancilla Domini, The Blue Bower, Dante’s Dream at the Time of the Death of Beatrice, La Ghirlandata and the pastel version of Proserpine
