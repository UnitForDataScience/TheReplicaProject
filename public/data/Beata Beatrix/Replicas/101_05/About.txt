Auction house Christie's is to announce the sale of arguably the most famous of all Pre-Raphaelite images, Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s (1828-1882) Beata Beatrix, at an estimated price of £1,500,000-2,500,000. This pastel work is signed and dated from 1872 and is a later version of the oil painting of the same title, 1864-70, which is now hanging in the permanent collection of Tate Britain.  The immediate appeal of the subject led to Rossetti being asked to execute a number of versions in different media but the present work is the only one he ever executed in pastel. The artist regarded the picture as a memorial to his wife Elizabeth Siddall who died tragically young of a laudanum overdose in 1862. http://www.50connect.co.uk/articles/rossetti-masterpiece
