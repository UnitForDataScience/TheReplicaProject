Grenville Lindall Winthrop (1864-1943) was an American lawyer and art collector from New York City. A direct descendant of John Winthrop, first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, he restored historic buildings in Lenox, MA, and assembled a large art collection in his NYC upper East side townhouse. He bequeathed his entire art collection to the Fogg Art Museum of his alma mater, Harvard University. He was influenced by Charles Eliot Norton, Harvard professor of art history, and his nephew, Francis Bullard, two prominent Boston art collectors from Boston. He was assisted in collecting by Martin Birnbaum, an art dealer from New York City. Winthrop collected early Wedgwood, Pre-Raphaelite paintings, Mesoamerican masks, Italian paintings, French drawings, clocks, Korean Buddhas. Initially, he focused on collecting the bulk of a given artist's work and owned the largest individual collection of paintings by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and William Blake. Additionally, he owned paintings by Edward Burne-Jones, Honoré Daumier, Jacques-Louis David (including his sketchbooks), Vincent van Gogh, Winslow Homer, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Auguste Rodin, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, G. F. Watts, John Singer Sargent, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Gustave Moreau, Théodore Géricault, Eugène Delacroix, Théodore Chassériau, John Singleton Copley, Gilbert Stuart, and Aubrey Beardsley. His collection amounted to 4,000 objects by the time of his death.
