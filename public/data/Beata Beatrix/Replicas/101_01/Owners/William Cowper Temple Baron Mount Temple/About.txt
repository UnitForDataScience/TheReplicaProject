William Francis Cowper-Temple, 1st Baron Mount Temple  (1811-1888), known as William Cowper (pronounced "Cooper") before 1869 and as William Cowper-Temple between 1869 and 1880, was a British Liberal Party politician and statesman. In 1835, Cowper was elected Liberal MP for Hertford, a seat he held for 33 years, and became private secretary to his uncle Prime Minister Lord Melbourne. In 1869, he inherited a number of estates and took the additional surname of Temple. The properties included a 10,000 acre estate on Sligo's Mullaghmore peninsula with its unfinished Classiebawn Castle, which he completed by 1874. In 1880 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Mount Temple, of Mount Temple in the County of Sligo. He sought to improve the nation's health and rebuild London, and famously amended the Education Act in 1870. His charismatic wife, Georgina, was also champion of diverse social and moral reforms, and friend to such worthies as John Ruskin, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Frances Power Cobbe and Mrs Oscar Wilde.
