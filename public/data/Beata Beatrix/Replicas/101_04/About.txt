The Graham replica, almost identical in size with the first version but with the addition of a predella, is in the Hutchinson collection of the Art Institute. According to Rossetti, "The picture illustrates the 'Vita Nuova,' embodying symbolically the death of Beatrice as treated in that work. The picture is not intended at all to represent death, but to render it under the semblance of a trance in which Beatrice, seated at a balcony overlooking the city, is suddenly rapt from earth to heaven." A bird carries the white poppy of death, while in the background are Dante and Love. The predella represents the meeting of the lovers in Paradise, attendant maidens playing musical instruments. On the top of the frame, designed by Rossetti, are the words, "Jan. Die 9 Anno 1290," the date of Beatrice's death, and the phrase "Quomodo Sedet Sola Civitas" ("How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is become as a widow she that was great among the nations."—“Lamentations,” I, 1). At the base is the date of Dante's death, "Mart. Die 31. Anno 1300," and "Veni, Sponsa, De Libano."
