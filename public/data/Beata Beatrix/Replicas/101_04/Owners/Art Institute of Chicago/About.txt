The museum was founded 1879, shortly after the Chicago fire of 1871. Today it houses about 300,000 works of arts—from ancient art through to contemporary works—and visitors number 1.5 million annually from across the globe. The classical Beaux-Arts building by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge was the site of the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions. The Art Institute officially opened on December 8, 1893. Within a year, the Art Institute had received its first major gift, a collection of French paintings presented by Mrs. Henry Field. Two significant improvements to the building followed: Fullerton Auditorium (1898) and Ryerson Library (1901). In 1913 the museum startled the city by hosting the Armory Show, a sprawling exhibition of avant-garde European painting and sculpture. Exceptional purchases from that controversial exhibition launched the museum's collection of modern art.
