The Scottish National Gallery is located on The Mound in central Edinburgh, in a neoclassical building designed by William Henry Playfair, and first opened in 1859. The gallery houses Scottish and international art from the beginning of the Renaissance up to the start of the 20th century. The origins of Scotland's national collection lie with the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland, founded in 1819. It began to acquire paintings, and in 1828 the Royal Institution building opened on The Mound. In 1826, the Scottish Academy was founded by a group of artists as an offshoot of the Royal Institution, and in 1838 it became the Royal Scottish Academy (RSA). A key aim of the RSA was the founding of a national collection. It began to build up a collection and from 1835 rented exhibition space within the Royal Institution building. In the 1840s, plans were put in place for a new building to house the RSA. On 30 August 1850, Prince Albert laid the foundation stone. Its collection includes works by Van Dyck, Bernini, Botticelli, Canova, Cezanne, Chardin, Constable, Degas, Gainsborough,  Goya, Gauguin, El Greco, Ingres, Monet, Poussin, Rembrandt, Reynolds, Seurat, Titian, Turner, Morisot, Rubens, Hals, Holbein, van Gogh, Delacroix, Courbet, Vermeer, Watteau, and Tiepolo, among many other Old Masters and modern artists. The National Gallery did not receive its own purchase grant until 1903.
