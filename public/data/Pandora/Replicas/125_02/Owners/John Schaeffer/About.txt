John Schaeffer, Dutch-born, Australia-based businessman and art collector made a fortune in cleaning and security services: his company Tempo had 23,000 employees but is now sold. He once made the market for Victorian art, building Australia's top collection in the field. Schaeffer began as a ship's steward when he emigrated to Australia in the late 1950s. His initial collecting interest was in 19th-century Australian pictures. A seminal moment was when he saw the Tate's 1984 exhibition The Pre-Raphaelites.  But he hit rock bottom in 2002, with large debts and a divorce and sold 90 % of his art collection. He has started buying Victorian art again, has a new business venture and has lent half of his remaining collection, 23 works, to Leighton House Museum in London. His loans to Leighton House include Birth of Eve (c1908) by Solomon J Solomon, as well as John Waterhouse's Mariamne Leaving the Judgement Seat of Herod (1887). Schaeffer is a part owner of the British Movietone Archive.[1] Schaeffer is board member of the National Gallery of Australia Foundation, as well as a board member and Life Governor of the Art Gallery of New South Wales.
