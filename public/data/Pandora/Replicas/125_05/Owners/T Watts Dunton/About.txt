Theodore Watts-Dunton (1832-1914) was an English critic and poet. He is often remembered as the friend and minder of Algernon Charles Swinburne, whom he rescued from alcoholism.
He was educated as a naturalist, then qualified as a solicitor and went to London, where he practiced. One of his clients was Swinburne, whom he befriended in 1872. He contributed regularly to the Examiner from 1874 and to the Athenaeum from 1875 until 1898, where he was for over twenty years the principal critic of poetry. He wrote widely for other publications and contributed several articles to the Encyclopædia Britannica; the most significant was on Poetry in the ninth edition. Watts-Dunton befriended Tennyson, Rossetti and Swinburne' with whom he lived for nearly thirty years until Swinburne's death in 1909. Watts-Dunton married Clara Reich on 29 November 1905.
