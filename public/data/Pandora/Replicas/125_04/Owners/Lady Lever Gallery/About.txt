The Lady Lever Art Gallery museum was founded and built by the industrialist and philanthropist William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme, in honor of his wife, and opened in 1922. It is set in the garden village of Port Sunlight, close to Liverpool. It houses major collections of fine and decorative art that express Lord Leverhulme’s taste and collecting. The collection is strongest in British 19th-century painting and sculpture, along with late 18th-century and early 20th works. There are also important collections of English furniture, Wedgwood, especially jasperware, Chinese ceramics, and other types of objects, such as Ancient Greek vases and Roman sculpture. The majority of objects were part of the original donation, but the collection has continued to expand at a modest rate. The gallery is now part of National Museums Liverpool.
