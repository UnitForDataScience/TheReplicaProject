Thomas Eustace Smith (1831–1903) was an English shipping magnate and Liberal Party politician. He was elected at the 1868 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tynemouth and North Shields, having stood unsuccessfully in Dover at the 1865 general election. He was re-elected in Tynemouth and North Shields at the 1874 and 1880 elections, and retired from the House of Commons when the constituency was abolished at the 1885 general election. In 1855 he married Martha Mary Dalrymple (1835-1919), art patron. In 1860 Eustace Smith inherited his father’s business worth £60,000 a year. Eustace and Martha Smith had ten children. In 1868, Eustace Smith was elected Liberal MP for Tynemouth, a seat he held until 1885.  Between 1865 and 1875 the Smiths assembled a spectacular collection of Aesthetic movement paintings at 52 Prince's Gate, opposite Hyde Park in fashionable Kensington with interiors by George Aitchison, and Walter Crane. Watts's portrait of Ellen Terry, Choosing (1865; NPG), was one of the first acquired by Eustace, about 1865. Watts painted Smith’s portrait (c.1872; Tate). The initiative to collect was Martha’s, who called herself Eustacia. Leighton painted her portrait (c.1870; priv. coll.) and she may have modeled for Venus Disrobing (1867; priv. coll.). She collected Rossetti’s Pandora (1869;Faringdon Collection), Albert Moore's A Garden (1870, Tate), Watts's The Wife of Pygmalion (1868; Faringdon Collection), and Burne-Jones's Cupid and Psyche (1867; Fulham Public Library). She collected Frenchman Alphonse Legros’s works about 1872–3. The scandal of their daughter Virginia’s possible affair with Charles Dilke led Eustace to sell the Prince's Gate house and paintings to Alexander Henderson, later Baron Faringdon. The Smiths spent 15 years in self-imposed exile in Spain, returned to England in 1900 and commissioned a house, High Coxlease, in Lyndhurst, Hampshire from W. R. Lethaby.  DNB, Wilcox entry
