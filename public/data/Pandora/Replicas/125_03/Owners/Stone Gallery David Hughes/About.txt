The Stone Gallery was established in 1918 in Newcastle and bought by Tilly Marshall in 1937. Since then the Stone Gallery sold fine art by such artists such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti and L. S. Lowry, jewelry by Georg Jensen, modern and antique paperweights, enamel boxes and the family's own jewelry they create.
