Charles Fairfax Murray (1849-1919) was an artist, art connoisseur, collector and dealer who made important contributions to the South Kensington Museum’s collections: in particular its items of early majolica. He also painted the panels in the Museum’s Green Dining Room, working to Edward Burne-Jones’ designs. Murray entered Edward Burne-Jones’s studio as an assistant in 1866-7 In 1867 he exhibited at the Royal Academy and began to work for William Morris. He transferred designs onto stained glass, executed miniature illustrations for Morris’s poems and painted panels onto furniture. Murray worked as an assistant in Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s workshop (1869-70), became a copyist for John Ruskin. Murray accompanied Morris to Bruges and in 1871-72 travelled in Italy. In 1875 he married Angelica Albina Collevicchi (d. c. 1927), and he settled in Florence in 1878, where he became increasingly active as a collector and dealer.
In 1883, Murray started to p return to London. In 1886 he took a studio in Holland Park and started to paint again, mainly copies after Rossetti and works in the late Pre-Raphaelite style. Murray started to act as adviser and agent for the art dealers Agnew’s and Colnaghi and for the Fitzwilliam Museum, the National Gallery and the South Kensington Museum (now Victoria & Albert Museum). He helped establish a number of important American collections, including the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Fog Art Museum at Harvard University. He remained in Italy until 1884-5, after which he returned periodically to London. Murray sold most of his personal collection during his lifetime: his Pre-Raphaelite paintings to the Birmingham City Museum in 1903-06 and his Italian Renaissance drawings to John Pierpont Morgan in 1907-11. He donated Titian’s Tarquin and Lucretia and a rare aquamanile to the Fitzwilliam Museum. In 1895 he donated Burne-Jones’s model for the mosaic decoration of the American church in Rome to the Museum.
