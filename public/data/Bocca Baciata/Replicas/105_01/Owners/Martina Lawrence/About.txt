Martina Louise Lawrence (Brandegee) (1906-1959), Born Jamaica Plain, Boston MA. Daughter of Edward Deshon Brandegee and Mary Bryant Brandegee 
Wife of James Lawrence, Jr.  Mother of Albright (Lawrence); sister of John Langdon Brandegee . Half sister of Marion Sprague and Eleanor Sprague. During WWII, Martina Brandegee Lawrence took what Lee Albright called “a correspondence course,” and while there are no more specifics to offer, at least none that have survived, somehow this (typed) piece of writing was one of the results. Part essay, part letter to a friend, part meditation, Martina writes here about some of the men she knew as a child who made a deep impression on her.
