James Lawrence Jr. (1906-95), an architect who designed a number of public structures in the Boston area was a leading preservationist of the city's historical landmarks. Mr. Lawrence was born in Milton, Mass. He graduated from Harvard University in 1929, and in 1935, received a master's degree in architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During World War II, he served as a major in the Army Air Forces. He was a fellow of the American Institute of Architects, and in 1976 he was named a Benjamin Franklin Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. For 60 years, Mr. Lawrence helped lead the fight to protect Back Bay's stately elm trees on Commonwealth Avenue from threatened high-rise construction and he advocated legislation to require city utility lines to be buried. He also helped forge a compromise that allowed the financially troubled Boston Athenaeum to keep its famous portraits of George and Martha Washington in Boston by having them shared for alternating three-year periods by the National Portrait Gallery in Washington and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. As an architect, he helped design the Mary Ellen McCormack public-housing development in South Boston. He also designed the Gothic-style greenhouses at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, as well as the museum's cafe, shop and library. For over 30 years, he served as a member of the New England committee of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund; he received the organization's Thurgood Marshall Award in the 1970s. Mr. Lawrence's first wife, Martina, died in 1959. He is survived by his wife, Frances; three sons and a daughter from his first marriage; three stepchildren, and seven grandchildren.
