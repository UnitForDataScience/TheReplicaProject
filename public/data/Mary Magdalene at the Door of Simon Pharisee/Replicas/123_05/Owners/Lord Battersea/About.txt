Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea (1843-1907) was a British Liberal politician and patron of art. Flower was the eldest of five sons, was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, and was called to the Bar, Inner Temple, in 1870. Like his father, Flower was involved in property development, developing Battersea's Park Town and the mansion blocks lining the south side Prince of Wales Drive, London. In 1880 Flower entered Parliament for Brecon, a seat he held until 1885 when the constituency was abolished, and then represented Luton until 1892. He served briefly as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from in 1886 in the third administration of William Gladstone who, in 1892, raised him to the peerage as Baron Battersea of Battersea in the County of London and of Overstrand in the County of Norfolk. Apart from property development and politics, he was also a collector and patron of art, especially James McNeill Whistler and the Pre-Raphaelites.
