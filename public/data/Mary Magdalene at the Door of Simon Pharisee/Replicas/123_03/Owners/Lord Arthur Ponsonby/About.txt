Arthur Augustus William Harry Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede (1871-1946), was a British politician, writer, and social activist. He was the third son of Sir Henry Ponsonby, Private Secretary to Queen Victoria, and the great-grandson of The 3rd Earl of Bessborough. Ponsonby wrote Falsehood in War-time, Containing an Assortment of Lies Circulated Throughout the Nations During the Great War (1928). He was educated at Eton College.  In Parliament, Ponsonby opposed the British involvement in the First World War; he was a member of the Union of Democratic Control, a prominent anti-war organization in Britain. In 1924, Ramsay MacDonald appointed Ponsonby Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; he later served as Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport in 1929. In 1930, he was raised to the peerage as a hereditary Baron, a Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede. He led the Labour Party in the House of Lords (1931-1935), resigning in opposition to the party's policy on sanctions against Italy for its invasion of Abyssinia.
