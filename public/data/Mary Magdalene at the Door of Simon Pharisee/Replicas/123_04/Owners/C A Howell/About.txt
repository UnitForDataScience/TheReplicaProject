Charles Augustus Howell (1840-1890) was an art dealer and alleged blackmailer who is best known for persuading the poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti to dig up the poems he buried with his wife Elizabeth Siddall. His reputation as a blackmailer inspired Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, "The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton.” Howell was born in Oporto, Portugal to an English father, Alfred William Hervey Howell, and a Portuguese mother. He claimed to have aristocratic Portuguese ancestry, and would wear a red ribbon of the Portuguese Order of Christ, which he proclaimed to be an inherited family order. He moved to Britain in his youth, allegedly after having been caught cheating at cards. Howell was the friend and business agent of both Rossetti and John Ruskin. Ruskin employed him as a secretary between 1865 and 1868. Ruskin trusted Howell with "affairs needing delicate handling and a wise discretion". This was usually to manage Ruskin's discreet charitable donations. But Howell sought increasingly to obtain complete control of Ruskin's finances. Eventually Edward Burne-Jones persuaded Ruskin to sever his connection with Howell. According to Rossetti's brother William Michael Rossetti, Howell was a skilful salesman. His ability to exploit people's interests secured Rossetti several commissions. Howell organized the exhumation of Dante Gabriel Rossetti's wife Elizabeth Siddal and the retrieval of the poems he had left in her coffin in 1869. Rossetti insisted that the exhumation be kept absolutely secret. Howell also became a business adviser to poet Algernon Swinburne but Howell tried to sell Swinburne’s letters to him. Howell's connection with the Rossetti family is said to have ended when he was alleged to have persuaded his lover Rosa Corder to create fake Rossetti drawings.
