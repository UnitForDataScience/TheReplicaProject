James Leathart (1820–1895), lead manufacturer and art collector. He worked for the company of Locke, Blackett & Co. In Newcastle for most of his career, eventually becoming sole managing partner. Although his salary never exceeded £600 per annum, he managed to assemble one of the finest collections of contemporary art in England. He introduced the works of the Pre-Raphaelites into the conservative community of Newcastle businessmen.  He met William Bell Scott while Scott was head of an art school in New Castle. Through Scott, Leathart was introduced to Dante Gabriel Rossetti and other members of the P.R.B. He paid Rossetti to continue working on his unfinished Found painting.  Leathart is also an example of an early captain of the industrial revolution. He ran the Tyne Steam Shipping Company in Newcastle.
