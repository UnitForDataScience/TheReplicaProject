John Charles Holder, 1838-1923 first baronet, of Pitmaston in the County of Worcester, was a Justice of the Peace, High Sheriff of Worcestershire in 1903, Deputy Lieutenant of the county, and a Knight of Grace of St John of Jerusalem. Sir John's father was Henry Holder, a brewer of Birmingham. After Henry's death, Sir John carried on the business, which was amalgamated with Mitchell's & Butler's in 1919. Sir John was Chairman of the "General Hospital Building Committee." He was a benefactor of many charities, including the St John Ambulance Brigade and several hospitals. He was also Hon. Treasurer of the Lord Mayor's Relief Fund. A deeply religious man, he worshipped for many years at St Mary's Church, Moseley, and before that at Edgbaston Parish Church. He was a patron of the arts, and had a fine collection of paintings, some of which are now in our Birmingham Art Gallery.
