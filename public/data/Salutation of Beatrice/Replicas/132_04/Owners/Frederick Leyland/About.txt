Frederick Richards Leyland (1831–1892) was a major British shipowner, running 25 steamships in the transatlantic trade. He was also a major art collector, who commissioned works from several of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood painters.
Leyland served as an apprentice in the firm of John Bibby, Sons & Co, where he rose to become a partner. In 1867, he took on the tenancy of Speke Hall, Liverpool, and in 1869 bought a house in London at 49 Princes Gate. At the end of 1872, when the Bibby partnership dissolved, he bought out his employers and changed the company name to the Leyland Line in 1873. Under his direction the line expanded into transatlantic trade and by 1882 had 25 steamships. He retired from active business in 1888, leaving his son Frederick Dawson Leyland in charge.
Leyland's first commissions were to Dante Gabriel Rossetti and James McNeill Whistler, and date from 1864 and 1867. Leyland collected Renaissance art, as well as that of the Pre-Raphaelites, Whistler and Albert Moore. Leyland commissioned The Beguiling of Merlin, 1877, by Edward Burne-Jones. In the 1870s, Leyland commissioned Whistler to decorate his dining room. The resulting Peacock Room is considered one of Whistler's greatest works. After Leyland's death, his widow sold The Peacock Room to the American industrialist and art collector Charles Lang Freer who had it dismantled and shipped to the United States. It is now in the Smithsonian Museum's Freer Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. Leyland died in 1892. Leyland's funerary monument is the only such work by Edward Burne-Jones – the finest Arts and Crafts funerary monument in the UK, 
Leyland married Frances née Dawson (1834–1910) on 23 March 1855, but they separated in 1879. He and Frances had four children.
