<b>Felton Bequest</b> With no direct descendants Felton in his will established a philanthropic Felton Bequest to support culture and the community, with half the funding benefiting Victorian charities and the other half used to acquire and donate art works to the National Gallery of Victoria. The residue of the estate was £378,033. After the October Revolution the Bolshevik government sold a part of the collections of museums such as the Hermitage and Pushkin Museum. The Bequest acquired some of these for the National Gallery of Victoria. The bequest has acquired 15,000 art works, the current total value estimated at over A$2 billion.
