George Rae (1817-1902) was a British banker and stockbroker based in Birkenhead. He is most notable for his patronage of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and his commissioning and acquisition of works by Ford Madox Brown, Arthur Hughes and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. His commissions included Rossetti's The Beloved, commissioned in 1863 for £300 but only completed two years later.  He also acquired landscapes by local Liverpool artists like William J Bond and William Davis, hanging his collection in Redcourt, his house in in the Wirral.
