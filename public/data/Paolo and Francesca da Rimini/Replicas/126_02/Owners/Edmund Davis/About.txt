Edmund Gabriel Davis (1862-1939), born near Melbourne Australia, had trained as an artist in Paris, but was sent for his health to take up trading with his uncle in Africa. Later on, his business interests spread beyond Africa back into Australia and over to China. He did business in a host of commodities including guano, seals, ostrich feathers and later tin, asbestos, coal, copper, tungsten and predominantly chrome, in which he achieved a near world-wide monopoly. The power and wealth derived from his chrome mines in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) earned him the informal title ‘Napoleon of Northern Rhodesia’. In 1888 he married his first cousin, Mary Zillah Halford Bensusan (1866–1941). Both accomplished artists and connoisseurs, they became great patrons of the arts, amassing a collection including some of the finest artists, among them Rembrandt and Gainsborough. In 1927 a knighthood followed many years of widespread benefaction. Sir Edmund and Lady Davis were advised by the artists and aesthetes Charles Shannon and Charles Ricketts. Between 1922 and 1924, Sir Edmund employed Sir Herbert Baker, one of the most eminent architects of his day, to remodel the castle. Chilham he had bought. He left his collections to the National gallery of South Africa in Capetown and to the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris
