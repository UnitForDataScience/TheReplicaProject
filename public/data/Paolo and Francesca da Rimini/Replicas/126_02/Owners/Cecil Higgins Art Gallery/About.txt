The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum, Bedford is the principal art gallery and museum in Bedford, Bedfordshire, England, run by Bedford Borough Council and the Trustees of the Cecil Higgins Collection. The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum is situated in the Castle Quarter which occupies the site of Bedford Castle to the east of the High Street on the north side of the River Great Ouse Embankment. The Art Gallery & Museum reopened after an extensive refurbishment in June 2013. A £5.8m project has allowed the buildings to be joined together and redeveloped throughout, uniting on one site three previous cultural venues: The Higgins was chosen as its name for its connection with the site as the Higgins family home and business, and the prominent role the family played in the town including Charles Higgins (1789–1862) being mayor in 1848.
