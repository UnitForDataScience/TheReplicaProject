Louisa Caroline Baring (Stewart-Mackenzie), Lady Ashburton (1827 -1903) 
Kent House, Knightsbridge, Westminster, London, England (cancer )
Daughter of Rt Hon James Alexander Stewart-Mackenzie and Mary Elizabeth Frederica Mackenzie ; Wife of Bingham Baring, 2nd Baron Ashburton. Lady Ashburton was famous for her friendship with many of the greatest luminaries of the period including Landseer, Carlyle and Browning and as a liberal patron of the arts.  She already owned a replica of Rossetti's The Meeting of Dante and Beatrice in Paradise painted in 1863 and in 1864 during one of her visits to Rossetti's studio she asked him to paint Joan of Arc and a version of Venus Verticordia for her (the latter picture was sold to another collector). Joan of Arc was already hanging at Lady Ashburton's house by Christmas of that year when it was seen and admired by Lady Ashburton's close friend Pauline, Lady Trevelyan. The Ashburton house Seaford Lodge had only recently been built at Seaford in Devon and was being decorated in the fashionable Aesthetic style with etchings by Whistler and tiles and stained glass supplied by Morris and Co.  Louisa Ashburton was a woman of strong character and it is perhaps significant that she bought a painting of a willful and defiant heroine.
