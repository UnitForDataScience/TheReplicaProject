Thomas Agnew & Sons was a fine arts dealer in London. The firm began in a print and publishing partnership with Vittore Zanetti in Manchester in 1817; in 1835 Agnew took full control. The firm had long held a prominent position in the Bond Street trade in Old Master pictures. Agnew’s, as it is called, played a major role in promoting modern British art in the late-19th century. The founder’s sons, Sir William Agnew, 1st Baronet (1825–1910), who shifted the gallery trade to Old Masters, and Thomas Agnew (1827–1883) were pivotal in the firm’s rise in London. Sir William’s line produced in-house connoisseur (notably C. Morland Agnew [1855–1931]), while Thomas’s son, W. Lockett Agnew (1858–1918), followed the firm’s commercial development. During the 20th century and up to today, Agnew’s has placed many masterpieces in major museums in Europe, America, and in global markets.  After the firm was bought out in 2013 its archive was given to the National Gallery, London.
