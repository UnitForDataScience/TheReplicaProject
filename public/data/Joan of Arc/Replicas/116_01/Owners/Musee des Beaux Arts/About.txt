The Musée des Beaux-Arts de Strasbourg (Museum of Fine Arts of Strasbourg) is the old masters paintings collection of the city of Strasbourg, in the Alsace region of France. The museum is housed in the first and second floors of the baroque Palais Rohan since 1898. The museum owns circa 865 works (as of 2009), of which 250 are on permanent display. The Museum of Fine Arts of Strasbourg also owns a small but valuable collection of sculptures (mostly busts), principally from Italy and France.
