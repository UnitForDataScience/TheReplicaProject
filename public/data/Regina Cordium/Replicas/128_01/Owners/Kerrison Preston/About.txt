Kerrison Preston (1884-1975) was a Bournemouth solicitor and art collector who in the 1930s amassed a large collection of Victorian artworks, including Choosing by G. F. Watts. He wrote books on William Blake (The Blake Collection of W. Graham Robertson, London, 1952, and Blake and Rossetti, 1944) and collected Blake memorabilia and art. Preston bought Music, by Burne-Jones and commissioned by William Graham, after it sold at Christie&#39;s in 1934 for £147. Preston also owned Rossetti&#39;s watercolor of Hamlet and Ophelia (1866) commissioned by Merseyside lawyer A.T. Squarey. Both works entered the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford in 2008.Pcreston donated George Richmond’s Self Portrait (1840) to the Fitzwilliam Museum.
