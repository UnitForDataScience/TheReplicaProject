John Norman Bryson (1896-1976) was born at Portadown and educated at Bootham School, Queen’s University Belfast, and Merton College Oxford. He was a Lecturer in English at Balliol, Merton, and Oriel Colleges 1922-1940. He was a scion of an Ulster family trading in linen, and might have had some private means. A Fellow of Balliol from 1940, he was Fellow-Librarian and an Emeritus Fellow from 1964. Bryson’s publications are a book on the correspondence of DG Rossetti and Jane Morris (1976), a popular booklet on Robert Browning (1959,1963 and 1967), and a book on Matthew Arnold (1954). He wrote Pre-Raphaelites in Oxford. His major claim to original scholarly achievement was only published as a piece in The Times (13 Oct 1959 p 13 cont’d p 15): this reports the identification of a portrait of John Donne, the ”Lothian Portrait.” But the surviving material shows that he was a prolific reviewer of books, music, and theatre as a young and middle-aged man, often anonymously. He was also a collector, and left significant pictures to museums; see the account of his estate (net £195.975) in The Times 31 March 1977. Other pictures of his were sold at Christies on 22 July 1977 and 10 March 1978. His friends included poet John Betjeman (who spoke at his Memorial Service in Balliol Chapel, 27 Nov 1976), John Sparrow, Osbert Lancaster, Helen Gardner and many other literary figures.
