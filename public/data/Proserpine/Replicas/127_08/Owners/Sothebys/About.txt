Founded in 1744 by Samuel Baker, an entrepreneur, occasional publisher and successful bookseller, Sotheby’s is the oldest and largest internationally recognized firm of fine art auctioneers in the world. Baker was an entrepreneur, occasional publisher and successful bookseller who held his first auction under his own name on 11 March 1744. The dispersal of “several Hundred scarce and valuable Books in all branches of Polite Literature” from the library of Sir John Stanley fetched a grand total of £826.Baker concocted enticing advertising campaigns and produced authoritative catalogues. He was, as one colleague noted, a “joyous fellow” with a fondness for plum-colored coats. In 1767 Baker went into partnership with George Leigh, an auctioneer. In 1842 John Wilkinson, the firm’s senior accountant, became a partner and when the last of the Sotheby family died in 1861, Wilkinson took over as head of the business. Three years later he promoted Edward Grose Hodge, and restyled the company Sotheby, Wilkinson and Hodge, the name it carried until 1924.  In 1917 the company moved to the art district on New Bond St. A number of highly successful sales of prominent collections in the 1950 and 60 increased the company’s status and was followed by its global developments, becoming international when it expanded: from London to New York (1955), the first to conduct sales in Hong Kong (1973), India (1992) and France (2001), and the first international fine art auction house in China (2012). It has a global network of 80 offices and the company’s annual worldwide sales turnover is currently in excess of $4 billion.
