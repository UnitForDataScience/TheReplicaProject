Stephen Thomas Gooden (1856-1909)
Gooden and Fox was founded around 1903 by Stephen Thomas Gooden (1856-1909) and F W
Fox (dates unrecorded). Fox originally worked for Agnew&#39;s Gallery until 1903 when he set up
the partnership with Gooden.
After the death of painter and art collector James Orrock (1829 - 1913), Fox advised
philanthropist William Hesketh Lever (1851 - 1925) on his art purchases between 1915 and
1925. Lever relied greatly on Fox&#39;s judgements.
Gooden was a print publisher. He married Edith Camille Elizabeth Epps (1868 - 1954) and was
the father of engraver Stephen Frederick Gooden (1892 - 1955).
