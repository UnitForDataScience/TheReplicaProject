William Walker Sampson (1865-?) was born illegitimately in Tynemouth to Margaret Walker. Charles and Margaret were married at the parish church of Tynemouth, Northumberland, a maritime and mining community. William then had the Sampson surname added to his full name. William became the adopted son of Charles Sampson and was raised in Tynemouth and Newcastle. According to his obituary in the London Times, one of William’s first jobs was as a newspaper boy on the streets outside the Newcastle-Upon-Tyne railway station. By the 1881 census, at the age of seventeen, and living at Beech Street, Newcastle, William was noted as being a stationer, later to become one of the greatest art dealers and an impresario in theatre, literature, and entertainment.
