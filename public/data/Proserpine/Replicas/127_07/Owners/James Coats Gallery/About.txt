James Coats Gallery: James Coats was British and dealt privately out of his \ New York apartment, which housed Alma-Tadema’s decadent, seven-foot The Roses of Heliogabalus (1888).  He lent works to exhibitions at Robert Isaacson’s New York gallery, such as “Poetic Painters of the XIX Century” from December 1960 through January 1961, “Painters of the Beautiful” (Leighton, Albert Moore, Whistler, and Charles Conder) in 1964, and Simeon Solomon in 1966. He sold many Alma-Tadema works and works by James Tissot.
