Clara Jessup Bloomfield-Moore (1824-99), known to friends as "Lady B," was an art collector, philanthropist, writer and the widow of millionaire Bloomfield H. Moore, who made his wealth as a paper manufacturer in the Philadelphia area (after his death, she legally changed her surname to Bloomfield-Moore).  Bloomfield-Moore’s collection of more than one thousand objects, included, among other art objects, European and Oriental porcelains, oil paintings, textiles, metalwork, pottery, glass, enamels, carved ivories, jewelry and painted fans.  Bloomfield-Moore bequeathed her collection to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which received the first installment in 1899.
