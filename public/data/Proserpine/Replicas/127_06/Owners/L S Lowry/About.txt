Laurence Stephen Lowry RBA RA (1887-1976) was an English artist. Many of his drawings and paintings depict Pendlebury, Lancashire, where he lived and worked for more than 40 years, and also Salford and its surrounding areas. Lowry is famous for painting scenes of life in the industrial districts of North West England in the mid-20th century. He developed a distinctive style of painting and is best known for his urban landscapes peopled with human figures often referred to as "matchstick men." He painted mysterious unpopulated landscapes, brooding portraits and the unpublished "marionette" works, which were only found after his death. A large collection of Lowry's work is on permanent public display in The Lowry, a purpose-built art gallery on Salford Quays named in his honor. Lowry rejected five honors during his life, including a knighthood in 1968, and consequently holds the record for the most rejected British honors. On 26 June 2013 a major retrospective opened at the Tate Britain in London, his first at the Tate, and in 2014 his first solo exhibition outside the UK was held in Nanjing, China
