The Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology in Oxford, England, is the world's first university museum. Its first building was erected in 1678–1683 to house the cabinet of curiosities that Elias Ashmole gave to the University of Oxford in 1677. The present building, 1841–45, was designed by Charles Cockerell in a classical style and stands on Beaumont Street. The main museum contains huge collections of archaeological specimens and one of the best collections of Pre-Raphaelite paintings, majolica pottery, and English silver, Greek and Minoan pottery, antiquities from Ancient Egypt and the Sudan.
