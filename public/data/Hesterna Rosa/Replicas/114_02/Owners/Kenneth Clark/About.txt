Kenneth Mackenzie Clark, Baron Clark, OM, CH, KCB, FBA (1903–1983) was a British art historian, museum director, and broadcaster. After running two important art galleries in the 1930s and 1940s, he came to wider public notice on television, presenting a succession of series about the arts during the 1950s and 1960s, culminating in the series Civilisation in 1969. The son of rich parents, among his early influences were the writings of John Ruskin, which instilled in him the belief that everyone should have access to great art. After coming under the influence of connoisseur and dealer Bernard Berenson, Clark was appointed director of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and three years later put in charge of Britain's National Gallery. His twelve years there saw the gallery transformed to make it accessible and inviting to a wider public. During the Second World War, when the collection was taken away from London for safe keeping, Clark made the building available for a series of daily concerts which proved a celebrated morale booster during the Blitz. After three years as Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford, Clark became chair of the UK's first commercial television network and he was asked to create the first color series about the arts, Civilisation, first broadcast in 1969 in Britain and in many countries soon afterwards. Clark was knighted at the young age of thirty-five, and later made a life peer. 30 years after his death, Clark was celebrated in an exhibition at Tate Britain in London, prompting a reappraisal of his career by a new generation of critics and historians.
