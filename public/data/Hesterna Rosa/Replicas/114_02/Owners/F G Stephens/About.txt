Frederick George Stephens (1827-1907) was born to Septimus Stephens of Aberdeen and Ann (née Cooke) in Walworth, London and grew up in nearby Lambeth. Because of an accident in 1837, he was physically disabled and was educated privately. He attended University College School, London. In 1844 he entered the Royal Academy Schools where he met John Everett Millais and William Holman Hunt. He joined their Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848, often modelling for them. There is a pencil portrait of Stephens[3] by Millais dated 1853 in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. took up art criticism and stopped painting. He communicated the aims of the Brotherhood to the public. He became the art critic and later the art editor of the Athenaeum while writing freelance for other art-history periodicals including The Art Journal and Portfolio. He also wrote for journals on the continent and the United States. His contributions to the Brotherhood's magazine The Germ were made under the pseudonyms Laura Savage and John Seward. He allowed Rossetti to write reviews of his own work under Stephens's name. 
Stephen's art history book, Normandy: its Gothic Architecture and History was published in 1865, and Flemish Relics, a history of Netherlandish art, appeared in 1866. Monographs on William Mulready (1867) and Edwin Landseer (1869) followed. In 1873 he started writing a series of almost 100 articles on British collecting for the Athenaeum; these treated major collections and small collectors.
He was also Keeper of the Prints and Drawings in the British Museum and wrote most entries in the first volumes of the Catalogue of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum, Division I: Political and Personal Satires, from 1870 onward. In 1875, Stephens began to characterize himself as an art historian rather than a critic and in 1877 he started to write contributions for the Grosvenor Gallery catalogues, until 1890. When Rossetti died Stephens co-wrote his obituary for the edition of Athenaeum, 15 April 1882. In 1894, Stephens published a Portfolio monograph on Rossetti. Stephens' strong dislike of Impressionism ended his forty-year association with the Athenaeum.
Stephens married the artist Rebecca Clara Dalton in 1866. Their son was the engineer Holman Fred Stephens (1869–1931). At the time of the 1881 census the family was living at 10 Hammersmith Terrace, Hammersmith. Stephens died at home on 9 March 1907 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery. Much of his collection of art and books was auctioned at Fosters in 1916, after his widow's death, but his son bequeathed several works of art to the Tate Gallery.
