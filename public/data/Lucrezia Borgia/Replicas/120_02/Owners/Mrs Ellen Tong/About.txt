 “Mr. Craven and Mr. Tong possess some of the best pictures in Manchester. The drawing-room of Mrs. Tong—herself a leader of local Society, and endowed with a most cultivated taste in art—is graced with a collection of works by Burne-Jones and Rossetti of singular interest” (quote from review in Whitehall Review, 1878), cited in Alfred Darbyshire. An Architect’s Experiences (1897), 63.
