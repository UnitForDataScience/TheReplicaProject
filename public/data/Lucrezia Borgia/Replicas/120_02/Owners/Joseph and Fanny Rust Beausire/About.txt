Joseph Beausire (1844-1907) was a Birkenhead businessman and art collector. He was the son of Robert and Janet Beausire, born in Liverpool, Merseyside. He was education at the Liverpool College and began in business in 1862. He married Fanny Adela Mary Rust (1845-1933), daughter of Henry Rust in 1865. They had ten children together and resided at Claughton, Birkenhead and later at Wethersfield, Noctorum, Birkenhead (see B. Guinness Orchard Liverpool's Legion of Honour [1893], p. 158).  Beausire set up a trading company that operated between Liverpool, the West Indies and Latin America. He was Chairman of the West India and Pacific Steamship Company formed in 1863 by Liverpool merchants Arthur and William Forwood and also Director of the North and South Wales Bank formed in Liverpool in 1836. It is likely that Beausire travelled a fair amount during his life; he is recorded to have departed for Iquique, Chile, with the Pacific Steam Navigation Company shipping line in 1904. 
Beausire’s art collection included works by Rossetti, Burne-Jones, J. M. W Turner and Constable among many others. Although he died in 1907, most of his collection was not sold until 1934 (Christie's 13/04/1934, lot no. 20). Beausire’s grandson Cecil Francis Joseph Beausire (1898-1972) bequeathed many English watercolors to the Walker Art Gallery in 1970.
