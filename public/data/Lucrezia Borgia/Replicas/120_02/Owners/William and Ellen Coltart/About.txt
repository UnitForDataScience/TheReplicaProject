Ellen Coltart in her two marriages (first husband, Jonathan Tong, a yarn agent in Salford, died 1881, after which she married the iron merchant William Coltart), Ellen (or Eleanor) purchased directly from artists at London exhibitions and later from the dealer Thomas Agnew.  Critic F. G. Stephens visited the Coltarts’ house, Woodleigh at Claughton cum Grange, Birkenhead, and wrote about Rossetti’s watercolor replicas Lady Lilith (Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY) and The Borgia Family (Victoria and Albert Museum). Ellen and William Coltart’s breadth of taste and openness to Aestheticism, and their direct contact with painters (noted by AG Tempe in his article describing the collection), are reflected in their possession of two of Albert Moore’s most challenging works [Christopher Newall, Pre-Raphaelites: Beauty and Rebellion (Liverpool UP 2016), p. 57-60].
