Cecil French was born in Dublin and trained as an artist at the Royal Academy Schools, London, and at Sir Hubert von Herkomer's School at Bushey, Hertfordshire. He offered six works by Sir Edward Burne-Jones to the Fulham Public Libraries Committee for display in the libraries in 1953. In his 1952 will, French instructed one of his executors, Rowland Alston, Curator of The Watts Gallery, Compton, to distribute the remainder of his paintings to museums. In 1954, the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham received a bequest of 47 more paintings and drawings, the majority by Burne-Jones, and other Pre-Raphaelite and Post-Romantic examples of works by John William Waterhouse, Edward Burne-Jones, William Shackleton and George Fredric Watts. The paintings are now housed in Leighton House, Holland Park home of Frederick, Lord Leighton.  Some of French’s collection of over 150 paintings went to the British Museum, The William Morris Gallery, and other institutions.
