Charles de Sousy Ricketts RA (1866-1931) was a versatile English artist, illustrator, author and printer, best known as book designer and typographer from 1896 to 1904 with the Vale Press, and as a set and costume designer. Ricketts was born in Geneva to a French mother and an English father. He grew up mainly in France and Italy. He began his studies in art at the City and Guilds Technical Art School in Lambeth, in 1882, after both parents had died. At the Art School he met Charles Shannon (1863–1937), painter and lithographer, who would be his lifelong partner and they settled in England.
They founded The Dial, a magazine from 1889 to 1897, and the Vale Press, named after their house, The Vale, in Chelsea, London. Ricketts was one of two well-known illustrators of Oscar Wilde's work, the other being Aubrey Beardsley.  After 1902, he turned more to painting and sculpture. Ricketts also wrote on art, was a collector, and was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1922 and a full member in 1928. In 1929 he was appointed a member of the Royal Fine Arts Commission. He was also a member of the International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers. Ricketts became a celebrated and sought-after designer for the stage; plays on which he worked included Oscar Wilde's Salome (1906), Bernard Shaw's The Dark Lady (1910), Maurice Maeterlinck's The Betrothal (1920), Shaw's Saint Joan (1924), and several Shakesspear productions.  Outside London he worked for the Abbey Theatre, Dublin on plays by W. B. Yeats and J.M. Synge. Ricketts also designed new productions of The Gondoliers and The Mikado for Rupert D'Oyly Carte in the 1920s.
