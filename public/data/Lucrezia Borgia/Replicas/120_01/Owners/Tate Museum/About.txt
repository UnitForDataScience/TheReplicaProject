When Tate first opened its doors to the public in 1897 it had just one site, displaying a small collection of British artworks. Today we have four major sites and the national collection of British art from 1500 to the present day and international modern and contemporary art, which includes nearly 70,000 artworks.  In 1889 Henry Tate, an industrialist who had made his fortune as a sugar refiner, offered his collection of British nineteenth-century art to the nation and provided funding for the first Tate Gallery. Tate was a great patron of Pre-Raphaelite artists and his bequest of 65 paintings to the National Gallery included John Everett Millais’ Ophelia, 1851–2, and J. W.Waterhouse’s The Lady of Shalott, 1888. The bequest was turned down by the trustees because there was not enough space. A campaign was begun to create a new gallery dedicated to British art. With an £80,000 donation from Tate himself, the gallery at Millbank, now Tate Britain, was built and opened in 1897. Tate’s original bequest, together with works from the National Gallery, formed the founding collection. The arts and antiques dealers Sir Joseph Joel Duveen (1843–1908) and his son Lord Joseph (1869–1939) made financial contributions. With their support, extensions were added to the gallery to display the Turner Bequest in 1910 and the Duveen Sculpture Galleries, the first galleries build specifically for sculpture in England.
