Windus, (Benjamin) Godfrey (1790-1867), art collector, born on 15 January 1790 in Sun Street, on the corner of Bishopsgate, London, was the son of Edward William Windus (1766-1832) and Mary Godfrey (1768-1819). His grandfather Arthur Windus (1737-1818), who was descended from Hertfordshire parsons and lawyers, started a coach building business. He was the son of Edward William and Mary Windus, a family well known as makers of high class carriages and harness makers and prominent members of The Worshipful Company of Coach Makers which was one of the Livery companies of the City of London. The Winduses were particularly successful and highly respected in their business, being the company engaged in to keep the Lord Mayor of London’s coach in good repair and to maintain its appearance with fresh crimson velvet for public display. 
His mother’s father, Benjamin Godfrey, built up a fortune making and selling ‘Godfrey’s Cordial’, a mixture of opium, treacle and spices which was marketed all over the country. Benjamin Windus was later to sell his grandfather’s cordial business and thus he made his fortune from the proceeds of both cordials and carriages and from his directorship of Globe Insurance. In 1814 Benjamin married Mary Ro. They had two children. His wife died in 1830. In 1831 Benjamin Windus married Margaret Armiger who died in Tottenham in 1842. From his father, Windus inherited in 1832 the home Tottenham. He added a library to the side of the house where he shelved his books and displayed his growing collection of pictures. Windus was well known as a leading art collector of his time, collecting Turner watercolors and David Wilkie drawings, and many paintings by Millais, Holman Hunt and Rossetti’s tutor Ford Madox Brown. Regular visitors to the Windus home were the critic John Ruskin and artist J.M.W Turner. Windus’s collection in 1840 contained over 200 of Turner’s works. Benjamin Windus died in 1867.
