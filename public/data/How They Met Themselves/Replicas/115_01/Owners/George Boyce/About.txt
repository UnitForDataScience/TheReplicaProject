George Price Boyce was born in London, the son of George Boyce, a wine merchant turned pawnbroker. He went to school in Essex, and then in Paris. In 1843 he was articled to an architect named Little, with whom he remained for four years, then joining the architectural firm of Wyatt and Brandon. A meeting with artist David Cox in 1849 persuaded him to give up the architecture and take up painting/ He developed his own style under the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite painters Thomas Seddon and D. G.Rossetti  whom  he met about 1849 and William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais in 1853. In 1854 he went to Venice, where he sketched subjects recommended to him by the critic John Ruskin who corresponded with him during his four months in the city. His work from the late 1850s concentrated on English landscapes and vernacular architecture around Thames Valley villages and in Sussex and Surrey. In the 1870s he painted many views of Ludlow, and was increasingly drawn to more remote landscapes. In 1861, following the death of his sister, artist Joanna Mary Boyce, he went to Egypt, where he shared a house in Giza with Frank Dillon and Egron Lundgren until early 1862. Boyce exhibited oils and watercolors at the Royal Academy between 1853 and 1861. He was a founder member of the Hogarth Club and of the Medieval Society, formed mostly of architects. He was also a leading member of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. He exhibited frequently at the Royal Watercolour Society and was elected Associate in 1864 and Member in 1878. From 1871 he lived in Chelsea,  in a house designed for him by his friend Philip Webb. He retired from painting in 1893 through ill health. and died at West House on 9 February 1897. Boyce's diary is a major source of information on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.
