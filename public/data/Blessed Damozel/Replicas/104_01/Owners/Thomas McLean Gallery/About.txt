McLean’s Gallery
Thomas McLean (1788-1875) was a print dealer and publisher who
followed the common practice of exhibiting paintings as publicity for
the forthcoming engravings. His business premises were established
in the Haymarket well before 1865 at no. 7 Haymarket (Art Journal,
December 1865, 371). In the mid-1860s, he began holding annual
exhibitions of water color drawings, and quickly became known as
one of the leading dealers in London. Annually in May he had an
exhibition of oil-paintings; and in the autumn of water color
drawings. The business was taken over by Eugene Cremetti (The
Year’s Art 1911, 140) and conducted at this address until at least
1922.
