William Graham (1817 1885), Liberal MP for Glasgow, was a Scottish politician, wine merchant, cotton manufacturer and port shipper. He is remembered as a patron of Pre-Raphaelite artists like Edward Burne-Jones and Dante Gabriel Rossetti and a collector of their works. Graham was a friend and patron of Edward Burne-Jones since 1856. Graham invited artists to his country house, Stobhall, in Perthshire and began to buy from Rossetti in the mid-1860s. He commissioned Found for Â£800 in 1869; he took possession of the unfinished work after the painter's death in 1882. In 1871, Graham commissioned The Blessed Damozel (1871) and acquired La Donna Della Finestra (1880) from the artist. When they came on the market in 1874 and 1885, Graham bought Ecce Ancilla Domini (1850) and The Girlhood of Mary Virgin (1849) both now in the Tate Gallery. He commissioned the large Dante's Dream, although too big for his London House. Many of the pictures he owned are now in Tate Britain. After his death, his collection was sold at auction by Christie's in April 1886.
