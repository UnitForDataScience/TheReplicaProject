The Dundee Art Gallery is now McManus Galleries and in a Gothic Revival-style building. The building houses a museum and art gallery with a collection of fine and decorative art as well as a natural history collection. The concept for the building was originally commissioned as a memorial to Prince Albert and intended to contain room for lectures, museum, picture gallery and a reference library for students by the British Association for the Advancement of Science, all funded by the inhabitants of Dundee. Although the city could not afford such a lavish memorial outright, it did contribute £300. A guaranteed fund of £4,205 15/- from 168 contributors was collected which included a munificent gift from the Baxter family of £420. The building was designed by architect George Gilbert Scott, an expert on the restoration of mediaeval churches and advocate of the Gothic architectural style. The building was opened as the Albert Institute in 1867. Two further sections, which extended the building by four art galleries and four museum galleries, were added by 1889. The contents of the Watt Institute, founded in 1848, were incorporated into the collection before the opening of the civic museum and art gallery in 1873. Between 1873 and 1949, the buildings were administrated as part of public library service. From 1959, the city corporation took over the running of the administration. The building now commemorates the Lord Provost Maurice McManus.
