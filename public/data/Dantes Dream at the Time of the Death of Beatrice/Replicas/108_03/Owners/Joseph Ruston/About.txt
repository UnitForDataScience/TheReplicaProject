Joseph Ruston (1835 –1897) was an English engineer and manufacturer and Liberal Party politician, though he split from the party over Home Rule and retired. Ruston was the son of Robert Ruston a farmer of Chatteris, Isle of Ely, and his wife Margaret Seward. He was educated at Wesley College, Sheffield, and became apprenticed at a Sheffield cutlery firm. On completing his apprenticeship in 1856, he went into business with Burton and Proctor of Lincoln. He became head of the firm of Ruston, Proctor and Company, agricultural implement makers and engineers; this was a very successful company.  Ruston was a J.P. and was elected Mayor of Lincoln for 1869–70 and then as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Lincoln in a by-election in 1884. He was re-elected at the 1885 general election but did not stand again in 1886 because he disapproved of Gladstone's proposals for Home Rule. His decorations included the Cross of the Legion of Honour and the Order of Osmanieh. He was appointed High Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1891. He was a benefactor to the town of Lincoln, funding the building of the drill-hall for the local volunteers, a children's ward at the Lincoln County Hospital, and the restoration of the monument in Lincoln Cathedral to the memory of Queen Eleanor. Ruston married Jane Brown in 1859, and lived at Monks Manor. They had a son and six daughters.
