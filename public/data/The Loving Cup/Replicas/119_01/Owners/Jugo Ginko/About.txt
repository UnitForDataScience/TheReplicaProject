Jugo Ginko, the Fifteenth Bank, established 1877, the main aim of which was to preserve the assets of the ‘old noblemen’ consisting of kugyo and former daimyo. The bank survived thereafter, and even in the interwar period most of the shareholders were the ‘old noblemen’ as before. In addition, the Fifteenth Bank came to deal with the royal family in 1897, and the Ministry of Imperial Household became an important client in 1913. Therefore, the bank was greatly trusted by many Japanese people and was proud of its abundant deposits. In April 1927, however, the Fifteenth Bank was seriously damaged by the financial panic and went bankrupt once. Although the bank revived and lived on, many ‘old noblemen’, who invested in it, became poorer and economically declined before the postwar downfall. It was the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Finance, Matsukata Masayoshi, who came up with the idea that the government should let the peers establish a peers’ bank based on their bonds in order to overcome severe economic situations. FNB was reorganized into an ordinary bank, the Fifteenth Bank (FB), in 1897. “Industrial Development and Decline of Traditional Noblemen in Interwar Japan,” Takeshi Abe, Takenobu Yuki, and Izumi Shirai. http://ebha.org/public/C7:paper_file:62
