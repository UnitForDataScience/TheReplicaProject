Thomas Henry Ismay (1837-1899) was the founder of the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company, more commonly known as the White Star Line.  He undertook several grand projects including, in July 1882, the building of a private residence in Thurstaston on the Wirral Peninsula, designed by the renowned architect Richard Norman Shaw. Built of a local red sandstone, the property was completed in December 1884. It was named Dawpool.
