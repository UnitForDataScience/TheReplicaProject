Matsukata Kojiro (1865–1950) was the third son of Masayoshi Matsukata, a politician of the Meiji period who rose to the post of Prime Minister. After completing college preparatory in Tokyo, Matsukata went to America, obtaining a JD in law from Yale University. In 1896 Kojiro became the first president of the Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd. of Kobe. He was also at one time the president of the Kobe Shimbun newspaper company and of the Kobe Gas Company. He was later elected chairman of the Kobe Chamber of Commerce and served as a member of the Diet. Matsukata began to collect artworks in London in the middle of World War I; he had a fortune out of his shipbuilding business during the war, which allowed him to build a vast collection of artworks from painting and sculpture to furniture and tapestries, about 10,000 works, including about 8,000 Japanese woodblock prints acquired from Parisian jeweler Henri Véver, now in the Tokyo National Museum. 
In Japan's National Museum of Western Art (NMWA) in Ueno, central Tokyo, his collection formed the basis of the National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, what Matsukata hoped would become a museum specializing in Western art.
