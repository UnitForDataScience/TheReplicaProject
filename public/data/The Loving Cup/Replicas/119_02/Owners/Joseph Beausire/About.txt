Joseph Beausire (1833-1907) was a Birkenhead businessman and art collector. He was the son of Robert and Janet Beausire, born in Liverpool, Merseyside. He married Fanny Adela Mary Rust (1845 - 1933), daughter of Henry Rust in 1865. They had ten children together and resided at Claughton, Birkenhead and later at Wethersfield, Noctorum, Birkenhead.  Beausire set up a trading company which operated between Liverpool, the West Indies and Latin America. He was Chairman of the West India and Pacific Steamship Company formed in 1863 by Liverpool merchants Arthur and William Forwood. He was also the Director of the North and South Wales Bank formed in Liverpool in 1836. It is thought that Beausire must have travelled a fair amount during his life, and is recorded to have departed for Iquique, Chile with the Pacific Steam Navigation Company shipping line in 1904.  Beausire was a keen supporter of the arts. His collection included works from Pre-Raphaelite artists Rossetti (1828 - 1882) and Burne-Jones (1833 - 1898), and landscapes by JMW Turner (1775 - 1851) and Constable (1776 - 1837) amongst many others. Although he died in 1907, most of his collection was not sold until 1934 (Christie's 13/04/1934, lot no. 20). Beausire was also the grandfather of Cecil Francis Joseph Beausire (1898 - 1972) who bequeathed many valuable English watercolours to the Walker Art Gallery in 1970.
