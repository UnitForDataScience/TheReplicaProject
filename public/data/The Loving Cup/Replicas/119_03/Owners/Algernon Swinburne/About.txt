Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837-1909) was an English poet, playwright, novelist, and critic. He wrote several novels and collections of poetry such as Poems and Ballads, and contributed to the famous Eleventh Edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. Swinburne wrote about many taboo topics, such as lesbianism, cannibalism, sado-masochism, and anti-theism. His poems have many common motifs, such as the ocean, time, and death. Several historical people are featured in his poems, such as Sappho, Anactoria, Jesus and Catullus. He attended Eton College (1849–53), where he first started writing poetry. At Eton, he won first prizes in French and Italian. He then attended Balliol College, Oxford (1856–60) with a brief hiatus when he was rusticated[4] from the university in 1859 for having publicly supported the attempted assassination of Napoleon III by Felice Orsini. He returned in May 1860, though he never received a degree.  Poems and Ballads caused a sensation when it was first published, especially the poems written in homage of Sappho of Lesbos. Swinburne was influenced by the work of William Shakespeare, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Catullus, William Morris, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Robert Browning, Alfred Lord Tennyson, and Victor Hugo.
