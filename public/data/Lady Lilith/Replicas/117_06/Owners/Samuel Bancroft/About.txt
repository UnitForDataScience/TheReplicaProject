Samuel Bancroft, Jr. (1840–1915), a Wilmington textile mill owner, was “shocked with delight” upon viewing his first Pre-Raphaelite painting in 1880. Born to a Quaker family with English connections, Bancroft’s decision to collect Pre-Raphaelite art was highly unusual within the local community and in the United States as a whole. In 1890, Bancroft purchased his first Pre-Raphaelite work, Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s Water Willow. He built relationships with descendants of the Brotherhood, including Jane and Jenny Morris, Winifred Sandys, and Phillip Burne-Jones. As he became more sophisticated, he sought out archival documents as well as art. By the time he died in 1915, he had assembled the largest and most significant Pre-Raphaelite collection outside Britain. In 1935, his family donated his art and manuscript collection to the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts, and 11 acres of gently rolling countryside near Kentmere Parkway with the provision that a museum be built on the site to house the Pre-Raphaelite collection.
