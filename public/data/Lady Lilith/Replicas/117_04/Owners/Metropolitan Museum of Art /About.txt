The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 for the purposes of opening a museum to bring art and art education to the American people. It opened in 1872, and was originally located at 681 Fifth Avenue. The permanent collection consists of works of art from classical antiquity and ancient Egypt, paintings, and sculptures from nearly all the European masters, and an extensive collection of American and modern art. The Met maintains extensive holdings of African, Asian, Oceania, Byzantine, and Islamic art, collections of musical instruments, costumes, and accessories, antique weapons and armor from around the world. Interiors from first-century Rome through modern American design are installed in galleries. The "Met" is the largest art museum in the United States, the second most visited art museum in the world in 2016, and the fifth most visited museum of any kind. Its collection contains over two million works, among seventeen curatorial departments. The main building along Central Park is by area one of the world's largest art galleries. A smaller location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, contains an extensive collection of medieval European art. In 2016, the museum opened the Met Breuer museum at Madison Avenue in the Upper East Side, focusing on modern and contemporary art.
