Lucy Madox Brown Rossetti (1843-1894), daughter of Ford Madox Brown, was an artist, author and model associated with the Pre-Raphaelites and married to the writer and art critic William Michael Rossetti. She began painting in 1868, and along with her half sister Catherine, modelled and worked as an assistant under their father. Other female Pre-Raphaelite artists such as Georgiana Burne-Jones, the sister of Thomas Seddon and Marie Spartali Stillman also took lessons in the same studio. Working mainly in watercolours, she exhibited in Dudley Museum and Art Gallery from 1869 to 1872. Her painting, The Duet, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1870, was described by Dante Gabriel Rossetti as a "perfect picture." She stopped painting in 1874. She wrote the biography of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Mrs. Shelley, for John Ingram's Eminent Women series and it was published in 1890.
