Christie's is a British auction house. It was founded in 1766 by James Christie. Its main premises are on King Street, St James's, in London, and in Rockefeller Center in New York City in the United States. The company is owned by Groupe Artémis, the holding company of François-Henri Pinault. Sales in 2015 totalled £4.8 billion ($7.4 billion). It has the credit of selling the Salvator Mundi for $400 million, the most expensive painting ever sold. Founder James Christie conducted the first sale in London, England, on 5 December 1766, and the earliest auction catalogue the company retains is from December 1766. However, other sources note that James Christie rented auction rooms from 1762, and newspaper advertisements of Christie's sales dating from 1759 have also been traced. Christie's soon established a reputation as a leading auction house, and took advantage of London's new status as the major center of the international art trade after the French Revolution. From 1859, the company was called Christie, Manson & Woods. In 1958, it established its first overseas office, by placing a representative in Rome. The first overseas salesroom opened in Geneva, where Christie's holds jewelry auctions.
