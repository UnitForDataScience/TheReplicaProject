Herbert Hardwick Trist (H H Trist; 1852-1936) was a collector in his own right and later probably inherited or bought some of his father’s paintings in 1892. He acquired some works by Rossetti: Miss Herbert (1863), King René’s Honeymoon (1864), The Dancing Girl (1866) and Regina Cordium (1866) (a painting once owned by Fanny Cornforth). H Trist was recorded as living at 63 Buckingham Place in 1873 until at least 1879 and later recorded as living at 7 Beaconsfield Villas in 1887 but he may not have been from the same family. Herbert Hardwick Trist had at least one son, John R Trist (1881 census). In 1899 H C Marillier wrote Dante Gabriel Rossetti: An Illustrated Memorial of his Art and Life and two illustrations were printed by permission of Mr H H Trist (The Dancing Girl, Michael Scott’s wooing). Marillier discusses the painting of Bocca Baciata (The model for this was Fanny Cornforth) which was sold to George Price Boyce; ‘Rossetti painted several heads later after much the same pattern as Bocca Baciata, of which two, a Regina Cordium done for the late Mr Trist of Brighton and a water-colour of 1868 called Bionda del Balcone, may be regarded as inferior replicas.’ Marillier later writes that Rossetti produced ‘a bright little water-colour drawing for a window representing Christ Crowned, with a regal globe in his hand and above and below two pairs of winged angels. This was formerly in the possession of Mr Trist ...’ and ‘two small paintings and a crayon were produced for Mr J Hamilton Trist, or bought by him in 1866, these are the head of Miss Wilding called Regina Cordium and a nearly circular head of a Dancing Girl sometimes called the Daughter of Herodias’ .... the crayon design is still in the possession of Mr H H Trist.’ At the end of the book there is a list of paintings with their provenance and there are seven paintings connected to the Trist family.
