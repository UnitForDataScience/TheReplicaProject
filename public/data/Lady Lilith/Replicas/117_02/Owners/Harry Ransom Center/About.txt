The Ransom Center is an internationally renowned humanities research library and museum at The University of Texas at Austin. Visitors engage with the Center's collections through research and study, exhibitions, publications, and program offerings. Originally named the Humanities Research Center, it was founded in 1957 by Harry Huntt Ransom, English professor, dean, vice president and provost, president, and eventually chancellor. The origins of the Ransom Center trace back decades earlier when the University began to acquire a series of important private libraries. In 1917, English professor Reginald H. Griffith persuaded University regent George W. Littlefield to purchase the library of Chicago businessman John Henry Wrenn that contained nearly 6,000 first and rare editions of mostly seventeenth- and eighteenth-century English and American authors, manuscripts of the Brontë sisters, Alfred Lord Tennyson, and the Brownings. In 1921, the University purchased the library of George A. Aitken. Four years later, Miriam Lutcher Stark of Orange, Texas, donated her personal library notable for containing all four first folio editions of Shakespeare, and manuscripts and first editions by Byron, Shelley, Keats, and other Romantic writers. By 1952, the University's collection had reached one million volumes and was poised for rapid expansion in the decades to come under the visionary guidance of Harry Ransom.
