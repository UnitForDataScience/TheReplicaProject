Thomas Edward Hanley was born in 1893 in Bradford, PA into an industrial family, owning and running a local brick factory and involved in the American oil and gas industry. Hanley graduated from Harvard University in 1915 and during this time he began collecting manuscripts and first editions.  He eventually acquired an original edition of Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass .  Other authors he enjoyed collecting were D. H. Lawrence, G. B. Shaw, Dylan Thomas, and Samuel Beckett. His Hanley Collection included page proofs for James Joyce's Ulysses (eventually donated to the University of Texas at Austin).
