The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is an urban museum that is one of Israel's leading art and cultural institutions. The museum holds a rich collection of local art from the early 20th century until today including a department of contemporary and contemporary art with international works from the mid-19th century to the present and a Department of Fine Arts from the 16th to the 19th centuries.  Since its founding in 1932, at the initiative of the first mayor of Tel Aviv, Meir Dizengoff, in his private home on Rothschild Boulevard, beginning with his own small collection, the museum has changed its location and expanded significantly.
