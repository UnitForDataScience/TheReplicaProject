Henry Virtue Tebbs [Jr](1833-1899) was a solicitor, a friend of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt, and son of Henry Virtue Tebbs (1797-1876).  His library, inherited from his father  was sold in 1900. Henry and his wife Emily owned some of Rossetti’s works which they later gave to the Tate and the Ashmolean and he was a lender to the Burlington Fine Arts Club exhibition of Islamic art (1885).  Rossetti painted this portrait in January 1870 (see his letter to Emily Tebbs of 18 January 1870, Fredeman, Correspondence, 70. 6). Cambridge University archives has correspondence between William Holman Hunt and Tebbs.
