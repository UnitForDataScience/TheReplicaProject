William Richardson Moss (1845-1915) was a keen patron of the arts and having accumulated wealth through the cotton industry loved to spend it on art treasures of any kind. He had a tremendous collection of china, embroidery, pictures and books. He was a friend of the painter George Frederick Watts (1817-1904) and at least one of Watt's paintings Olympus on Ida formed part of his collection.  A keen art collector who owned a number of works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, he was the brother of artist Phoebe Traquair.
